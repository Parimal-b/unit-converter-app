<h1>Unit Converter Application</h1>
The Unit Converter app is designed to provide a seamless and efficient experience for users who need to perform unit conversions on their Android devices. While the current focus is on functionality rather than aesthetics, the layout can be enhanced and customized in future iterations.

<h2>Key Features:</h2>

<h2>Conversion Selection:</h2>
Users can choose the desired conversion type from a menu. This selection dynamically generates an input field and a convert button.
<h3>Conversion Process:</h3>
After selecting the conversion type, users can input the value they want to convert into the provided field. Upon clicking the convert button, the app processes the conversion and displays the result.

<h3>Conversion History:</h3>
The app maintains a scrollable list of previous conversions, allowing users to quickly access and reuse historical conversion values.
Each item in the list displays the converted result along with the corresponding original value and unit.

<h3>History Management:</h3>
Users have the option to delete individual items from the conversion history list, providing flexibility in managing saved records.
A "Delete All" button is available to clear the entire conversion history.

<h2>Technical Implementation:</h2>

<h3>MVVM Architecture:</h3>
The project is structured using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, ensuring a separation of concerns and maintainability of code.

<h3>Uni-Directional Data Flow:</h3>
The app follows a uni-directional data flow, enhancing predictability and making it easier to debug and understand the codebase.

<h3>Room Database:</h3>
Room library is employed for efficient local data storage, managing the conversion history with reliability and performance.

<h3>Dagger Hilt for Dependency Injection:</h3>
Dagger Hilt is utilized for dependency injection, promoting code modularity and ease of testing.

<h2>Future Enhancements:</h2>

<h3>UI/UX Improvements:</h3>
While the current focus is on functionality, future iterations may include enhancements to the app's visual appeal and user interface.
Customization Options:
Consideration for allowing users to customize colors and improve the overall layout can be explored in subsequent updates.
